## Project Title: COVID-19 Data Analysis and Exploration

**Project Description:** This project focuses on exploring COVID-19 data to gain insights into the global impact of the pandemic. Through SQL queries, the project aims to provide a deeper understanding of the virus's spread, vaccination rates, and other key metrics.

**Data Source:**
- The COVID-19 data used in this project is available at [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
- The dataset includes information on daily cases, deaths, testing, vaccinations, and other relevant variables.

**Script Overview:** The script provided in this project offers a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL queries. It covers various aspects of the pandemic, including case statistics, vaccination rates, testing, and the impact of stringency measures. 

The script utilizes the following techniques and features:

- Joins to combine multiple tables and datasets.
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to create derived datasets and simplify complex queries.
- Aggregate functions to perform calculations and summary statistics.
- Views to create logical subsets of data for easier analysis.
